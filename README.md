# Genetic_Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm made in Python to estimate a Weierstrass function

We solve this problem in 3 parts.

1) Evaluation of all our individuals using the difference between our predicted values and the actual values
2) Selection of the best individuals + crossing/mutation + random individuals to avoid eugenism.
3) Loop it until we surpass our precision threshold
